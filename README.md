A Night at Citizens Bank Park:
This audio narrative piece strives to mimic Game 3 of the 2023 World Series- the Houston Astros at the Philadelphia Phillies. As the Phillies take a 7-0 win, this is a game full of action. You can hear some specific batting highlights, ads from a proud MLB sponsor, action for the spectators from the Jumbotron, and many other typical sounds at a baseball game. 
This is an audio narrative assignment created by Janna Wohl.
